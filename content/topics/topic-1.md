The most popular mode for Nuxt. With SSR, also called "universal" or "isomorphic" mode, a Node.js server will be used to deliver HTML based on your Vue components to the client instead of the pure javascript.  
Using SSR will lead to a large SEO boost, better UX and more opportunities (compared to a traditional Vue SPA).

Because implementing SSR on your own can be really tedious, Nuxt.js gives you full support out of the box and will take care of common pitfalls.
